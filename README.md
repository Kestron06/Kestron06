Hello! I'm Kestron, software developer behind so many things it's getting hard to count. [Discord Support Server.](https://discord.com/invite/k3yVkrrvez)
I'm the primary developer behind Stewbot, MiiJS, Kestrogle, the soon to be released TheMiiMakers, in addition to hundreds of much much smaller projects.

Stewbot is a Discord bot that runs a lot of moderation, as well as features designed to entertain.
MiiJS is a Node.js `npm` package to be able to read, write, and convert Mii files from the 3DS/Wii U, Wii to and from JSON files, allowing for easy editing, creation, reading, and conversion from Node.js.
Kestrogle is a search engine that acts as a stand-in proxy between you and Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, so you see the most relevant results according to all three while also keeping them from associating your search activity with you.
TheMiiMakers is unreleased but will eventually be a website that allows you to do everything MiiJS does from a GUI in addition to sharing and browsing Miis.
