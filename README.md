Greetings. My name is Kestron, and I am a software developer behind a lot of different projects. [My website can be found here](https://kestron.com).

Some of the most notable projects include the following
- Stewbot is a Discord bot that runs a lot of moderation, as well as features designed to entertain.
- MiiJS is a Node.js `npm` package to be able to read, write, and convert Mii files from the 3DS/Wii U, Wii to and from JSON files, allowing for easy editing, creation, reading, and conversion from Node.js.
- Sleuth is a search engine that acts as a stand-in proxy between you and Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, so you see the most relevant results according to all three while also keeping them from associating your search activity with you.
- TheMiiMakers is unreleased but will eventually be a website that allows you to do everything MiiJS does from a GUI in addition to sharing and browsing Miis.
