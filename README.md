Yeah my last about me was no longer accurate at all LOL.

Hello! My name is Kestron, I'm a software developer that has been programming for more years than I can count at this point. My skills have only been strong enough to count as a software dev for a year or so however. I am a developer of a couple of Discord bots, many websites, soon to be Voice Assistants and Search Engines, and we'll see what else I end up doing.
